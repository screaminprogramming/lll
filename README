Low Latency Library

A low latency C++ library.  One use case is low latency financial
trading systems, however there are lots of other similar usecases. 

The title "library" is a mis-nomer, the goal is to make this a
header-only system, written in C++, that includes NO virtual
functions (virtual functions were invented by Satan to slow down
otherwise elegant code.)  Additionally, the code has no external
dependencies other than the C++ 11 standard libraries.

file is included in the top level directory.
